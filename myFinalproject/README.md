My Bsc Final project: calculate transmitter location.
Goal: calculate transmitter location using Time Difference Of Arrival (TDOA)
 and signal processing for radio frequencies which received from RTL-SDRâ€™s. 
 Hardware: 
 RTL-SDR NEWGEN RTL2832U.
 USB HUB.
 RF Transmitter ADF4351-PLL.
 2 Coaxial RF cable-10m,10cm.
 Software: Python 

3 Code scripts
1.recieving the data from the SDR
2.Calculating the time difference between 2 separate SDR
3.calculation TDOA to get 3 hyperbolas. 1 for each 2 SDRs.thier intersection represnts the transmitter location.
